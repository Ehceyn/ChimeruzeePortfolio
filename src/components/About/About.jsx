              In his free time, you&apos;ll find him swimming, traveling,
              listening to gospel music, singing (although he&apos;ll be the
              first to admit his singing voice is better suited for frogs than
              humans üòÇ), playing Scrabble, table tennis and football (although
              he&apos;s more of a spectator than a player üòå). Bottom line, he
              is a jovial, relatable guy who will quickly become a valuable
              asset to any team. Give him a chance and you&apos;ll see for
              yourself why we&apos;re convinced you&apos;ll love him too ‚ù§Ô∏èüòé
